GitHub's [repository archiving](https://github.com/blog/2460-archiving-repositories) feature
is very helpful for clearly marking abandoned projects, but it's missing a clear way for
people to put their hand up and say "I'd like to take this over".

This issues-only repo is my solution - I can put a link to this in the README file for
archived repos, and folks can file an issue here if they'd like to take one over.
